Being Your Own Boss and Background Checks on the Platform
There are many advantages of being a Tasker; you can make extra money, control your own schedule, market yourself, find new clients, be your own boss.

You are your own business and will be working as an independent contractor for your Clients that you connect with on the TaskRabbit platform. You are not an employee of TaskRabbit. We don’t supervise, direct or control your work-- you are responsible for how you present yourself to your Clients.

Our Terms of Service govern the use of the TaskRabbit platform by all Users. Please read them. We are looking forward to having you join us on the platform, so let’s get started.

By signing below I acknowledge that I have read and understood the Terms of Service, including the arbitration and class action waiver provisions found in section 20, and that I agree to the Terms of Service.
